# Dotfiles (The Brand New Super Hyper Ultra Mega Deluxe Enhanced 2) (WIP)#
### Optimized for Arch Linux and Hyprland
These configs are tested only in Arch and tailored for it.
Contents of `HOME-DIR` just like name suggests should be put in the home folder (remember to show hidden files).
Same Thing for `USR-DIR`.
Install script will be made (when I have time for that).
Not all fonts are required but they're cool.

### For base functionality you need  ###
 - `zsh`
 - `pokemon-colorscripts-git` (AUR)
 - `starship`
 - `kitty`
 - `catppuccin-gtk-theme-mocha` (AUR)
 - `papirus-icon-theme`
### All in one command
`yay -S zsh pokemon-colorscripts-git starship kitty catppuccin-gtk-theme-mocha papirus-icon-theme`

Some packages can be substituted for an alternative:
 - `lsd`, `bat`, `exa` (change in zsh config, bat and exa are installed automatically)
 - `hyprpaper`, `polkit-gnome` (Change in hyprland config)
 - `sddm` 
 - And Others if you force it enough

### What's not implemented that I'm aware of
 - QT
 - GTK4
 - `waybar`
 - `wofi`
 - audio visualizer (probably `cava`)
 - `fastfetch`
 - Translating things to English from Polish in some parts of the code
 - Screenshots of the desktop
