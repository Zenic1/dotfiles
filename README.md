# Dotfiles (New Super Ultra Deluxe 2 Version) #
### Optimized for Arch Linux
These configs are tested only in Arch and tailored for it.
Contents of `HOME-DIR` just like name suggests should be put in the home folder (remember to show hidden files)
Install script will be made (when I have time for that)
Not all fonts are required bot they're cool
### For correct functioning you need at least  ###
 - zsh
 - pokemon-colorscripts
 - starship
 - kitty
 - lsd
### All in one command
`yay -S zsh pokemon-colorscripts starship kitty lsd`
 
### This list is a subject to change at any moment because I said so :3
